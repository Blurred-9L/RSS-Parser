<h2>Final individual project for CUCEI's Compilers Class.</h2>

<p>
    The project consists of the making of a limited RSS Parser. This means that the final parser will not be enough to properly parse
    all RSS feeds. Basically, the parser will be able to identify the following tags:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>rss</li>
    <li>channel</li>
    <li>title</li>
    <li>link</li>
    <li>description</li>
    <li>item</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As output, the parser should produce a file with a specific name <em>(salida.txt)</em>, which will hold the information that was found on
    the RSS input file <em>(entrada.txt)</em> in a readable format <em>(kind of)</em>
</p>
